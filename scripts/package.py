"""Assemble the publishable site into _site/.

    python3 scripts/package.py

Copies only what belongs on a web server — the generated HTML, the assets, the
crawler files and the redirect tables — and leaves the sources, the build
scripts and the project notes behind. The GitHub Pages workflow uploads _site/,
and running this locally shows exactly what would be deployed.

It refuses to package a build that is older than the sources it came from, and
it prints the deployment target the build was made for, because _site/ is what
CLAUDE.md tells the operator to upload to Hostinger — shipping a Pages-targeted
build there would 404 every stylesheet, image and internal link and block
crawling, with no visible error.
